poker.c compiled using gcc version 7.2.0 (MinGW-W64 project)
poker.c was a school project (7th grade). It mimics a poker game between the computer (player_1) and an opponent (player_2). The program uses a self-refential type (Card) to create a linked list. 3 random cards are distributed to each player and the game rolls out.
